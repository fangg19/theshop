# üõç THE SHOP üõç

#### A **MERN** eCommerce website following [Brad Traversy's](https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-ecommerce/) tutorial.

I can't recommend enough this course to learn and develop more on your ReactJS skills. Following this I developed a fully functional online shopping platform which includes:

- User authentication and token authorization
- Password encryption
- User profile and order history
- Individual order details
- Admin management for
  - products (create/delete/edit)
  - orders (track/mark as shipped)
  - customers (delete user account or edit e-mail & username)
- PayPal and credit/debit payment methods (open to scale with other methods)
- Product review and rating system
- Product pagination
- Product search feature
